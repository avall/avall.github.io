    "des": "I am a software architect focused on backend. I have experience in Microservices architectures developed in Java (Spring Framework - Boot, Cloud), Kotlin and kafka (async). I am always very focused on looking for infrastructure level solutions (Camunda for orchestration or OPA to handle authorization policies) rather than custom implementations. Any infrastructure level solution is usually better than a custom implementation.",
